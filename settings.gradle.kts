// The video library depends on core by its published coordinate, and Gradle
// substitutes this checkout for it when the group and name match. That means one
// dependency declaration works three ways: against a published core, against a
// sibling checkout while both are being changed together, and in CI where the
// core repo is checked out beside this one.
//
// Without it, every core change would need a publish before this repo could see
// it, which is how two libraries that ship together drift apart.
// The substitution is spelled out rather than left to Gradle's automatic
// group:name matching. The core build sets its group from a Gradle property
// through the publish plugin, which is too late for automatic substitution to
// see it, and the failure mode is a "could not find tv.nomercy:..." that looks
// like a missing artifact rather than a composite that did not engage.
//
// Off on demand, because "it works here" has to be checkable. A developer with
// the sibling checkout always builds against it, which is what you want day to
// day and exactly what hides a release where the published core is missing a
// declaration the video surface uses. -PusePublishedPlayerCore forces the
// resolution a consumer gets.
//
// Opt-OUT rather than opt-in, which is the reverse of what the plan wrote. The
// composite already keys on the sibling being there, and CI clones one repo, so
// CI is on the published path with no flag at all. Making the local path opt-in
// instead would mean every ordinary build silently resolved a published core
// that may be older than the checkout sitting next to it.
