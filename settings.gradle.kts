// The video library depends on core by its published coordinate, and Gradle
// substitutes this checkout for it when the group and name match. That means one
// dependency declaration works three ways: against a published core, against a
// sibling checkout while both are being changed together, and in CI where the
// core repo is checked out beside this one.
//
// Without it, every core change would need a publish before this repo could see
// it, which is how two libraries that ship together drift apart.
// The substitution is spelled out rather than left to Gradle's automatic
// group:name matching. The core build sets its group from a Gradle property
// through the publish plugin, which is too late for automatic substitution to
// see it, and the failure mode is a "could not find tv.nomercy:..." that looks
// like a missing artifact rather than a composite that did not engage.

// The drop-in view is its own module because Compose is a dependency a consumer
