// Whether to hand decoding straight to the display pipeline.
//
// Tunneling lets a television decode and present without the frames passing
// through the app, which is what makes 4K HDR play on hardware that could not
// otherwise keep up. It is also the single most device-specific thing this
// player does, and every condition below is a device that broke.
//
// A pure function because the alternative is untestable: the real call is one
// setter on a track selector inside a player being constructed, and asserting on
// it means building an ExoPlayer. The decision is the part worth testing, so it
// is the part that got extracted.
