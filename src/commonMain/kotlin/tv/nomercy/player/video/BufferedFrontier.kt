import tv.nomercy.player.core.ports.TimeRange

// How far the buffer reaches from where the playhead is standing.
//
// One number out of a list of ranges, and the reason it is not simply the last
// range's end is what a seek does to the list. Jump back an hour in a long film
// and the engine keeps what it had: the ranges become [0, 90] and [3500, 3600]
// while the playhead sits at 5. A bar drawn from the last end promises an hour
// of buffer over a stretch that holds none, so the viewer drags into it and the
// picture stalls on a bar that said it would not.
//
// Four answers, and each one is a different sentence about the same list:
//
//  * inside a range — the buffer reaches that range's end, and no further,
//    because the next range is on the far side of a hole.
//  * no ranges at all — nothing is buffered. Not the position: an engine that
//    has read no data has not buffered the frame it is showing either.
//  * past every range — the last end, which is where the data stops.
//  * in a hole, or before the first range — the position itself, which draws no
//    buffer ahead of the playhead. This is the honest answer while a seek into
//    unbuffered territory is being served.
//
// Ported from the web player's own walk in `html5.ts`, where it sits on the
// video backend rather than in core for the same reason it sits here: audio
// engines report a frontier and video engines report holes.
public fun bufferedFrontier(ranges: List<TimeRange>, currentTime: Double): Double {
    // The FIRST range holding the position, matching the web's loop rather than
    // the widest or the nearest. Ranges arrive in order and do not overlap, so
    // there is only ever one — and picking differently would be a rule the
    // oracle does not have.
