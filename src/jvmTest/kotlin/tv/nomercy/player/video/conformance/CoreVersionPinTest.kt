// The core this library builds against is the core it ships with.
//
// The trio releases as one version — core, video and music always carry the
// same number — so what this library IS and what it RESOLVED must agree. They
// are written in two different files by hand, and they drifted through an
// entire renumber without anything noticing: gradle.properties went to 0.1.0
// while libs.versions.toml kept asking for 2.0.0-rc.1.
//
// Nothing failed. The library compiled, the whole suite passed, and every fix
// made in core was simply absent from the artifact a consumer resolved — which
// is how the desktop testbed came to run a months-old core and report defects
// that had already been fixed. A stale pin does not break a build; it makes the
// build measure the wrong thing.
