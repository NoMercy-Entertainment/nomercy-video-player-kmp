// What the framework declares, against what the ecosystem documents.
//
// The JVM gate asks the classes by reflection and Kotlin/Native has none, so the
// framework hands its catalogues over as values and this compares them to the
// same vendored contract the Kotlin side reads. Without it the Apple half of
// this library is checked by nothing at all: every Swift view compiles against
// whatever the framework happens to export, and a missing event is a binding
// that silently never fires.
